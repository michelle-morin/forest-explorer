* 10:30am - successfully displayed geojson features on map! Now, beginning the process of making each feature interactive.

* 12:15pm - successfully changed color of selected trail segment on mouse click, but need to implement method to remove the selected color from previously-clicked trails (to only have a different color for the currently clicked trail).

* 1:45pm - have been switching between using a functional component with state hooks and using a class component to change colors of selected trail. still unable to deselect previous trail.

* 2:55pm - spent the past hour scouring stackoverflow and google for solutions to the color issue I'm experiencing. still troubleshooting.

* 3:20pm - have not resolved color changing issue, but shifting gears to start working on a wireframe and component tree for the frontend.

* 3:48pm - added component tree to readme;

* 4:15 - implemented mouseover/mouseout color changes for trails, but color change on click now reverts to default style on mouseout :(

* 4:45 - updated prose in proposal and touched up readme

* 4:50pm - current state of the trail exploration page (TrailMap component). This is a static shot; the map is a slippy map with pan/zoom:
